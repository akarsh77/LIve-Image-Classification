# LIve-Image-Classification
A real-time Image Classification app made using Google's Tensorflow.js

# Key- Points
1. We made use of a pre-trained image classification model called "MobileNet"
2. We used ml5.js, a library built on top of TensorFlow.js, to load the MobileNet model into our browser and perform inference on the video feed.
3. We also leveraged the P5.js library to process the video feed and display labels on the video itself
